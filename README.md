# react-fast-image

Early stages performant React image component.

I'm not sure the API will be similar to React Native Fast Image, but I didn't want to think up another name.

If this goes well I might merge the projects.

## Usage

```bash
npm install react-fast-image
# or
yarn add react-fast-image
```
